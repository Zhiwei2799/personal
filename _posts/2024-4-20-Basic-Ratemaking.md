## Chapter 1 Introduction
**FUNDAMENTAL INSURANCE EQUATION**
- **Price = Cost + Profit**
- **Premium= Losses + LAE + UW Expenses + UW Profit**
### Exposure 
The basic unit of risk underlying the insurance premium includes written, earned, unearned, and in-force exposures
- **Written exposures** are the total exposures arising from policies issued (i.e., underwritten or
written) during a specified period of time, such as a calendar year or quarter.
- **Earned exposures** represent the portion of the written exposures for which coverage has already
been provided as of a certain point in time.
- **Unearned exposures** represent the portion of the written exposures for which coverage has not
yet been provided as of that point in time.
- **In-force exposures** are the number of insured units that are exposed to loss at a given point in
time. 

### Premium
 The amount the insured pays for insurance coverage includes written, earned, unearned, and in-force premium
- **Written premium** is the total premium associated with policies that were issued during a
specified period.
- **Earned premium** represents the portion of the written premium for which coverage has already
been provided as of a certain point in time.
- **Unearned premium** is the portion of the written premium for which coverage has yet to be
provided as of a certain point in time.
- **In-force premium** is the full-term premium for policies that are in effect at a given point in time.

### Claim
- An **insurance policy** entails the insured paying a premium to the insurer for coverage against specific events. 
- When such an event occurs, the insured (now the **claimant**) files a claim. The event's date is known as the **date of loss** or **accident date**.
- Claims unknown to the insurer at a given time are termed **unreported claims** or **incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims**
- After the report date, a claim becomes known to the company and is classified as a **reported claim**. It remains an **open claim** until settled, after which it is considered closed. However, claims can be reopened if further activity occurs post-closure.

### Losses	
Loss under an insurance policy is the compensation amount payable to the claimant. Loss terminology includes paid loss, case reserve, reported or case incurred loss, IBNR/IBNER reserves, and ultimate loss. 
- **Paid loss** is amounts already disbursed to the claimant.
- **Case reserve** is an estimate of the amount of money required to ultimately settle the claim, it excludes any payments already made. 
- **Reported loss** is equal to Paid loss + Case reserve
- **Ultimate loss** is the total required to settle the claim. Estimated Ultimate Loss equal to Reported Loss + IBNR Reserve + IBNER Reserve. 

### Loss Adjustment Expense (LAE)
In addition to the money paid to the claimant for compensation, **loss adjustment expenses (LAE)** are costs insurers incur while settling claims, divided into **allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE)** and **unallocated
loss adjustment expenses (ULAE)**:

LAE =  ALAE + ULAE.

- ALAE are claim-related expenses that are directly attributable to a specific claim; for example, fees
associated with outside legal counsel hired to defend a claim can be directly assigned to a specific claim.
- ULAE are claim-related expenses that cannot be directly assigned to a specific claim. For example,
salaries of claims department personnel are not readily assignable to a specific claim and are categorized
as ULAE.

### Underwriting Expenses (UW Expenses)
In addition to loss adjustment expenses, underwriting expenses are costs insurers incur for various expenses in acquiring and servicing policies. 
- **Commissions and brokerage**: are payments made to insurance agents or brokers for generating business.
- **Other acquisition costs**: are expenses beyond commissions and brokerage, such as those for media advertising and mailings to potential customers.
- **General expenses**: are the operational and any other miscellaneous costs. For example, upkeep for the home office.
- **Taxes, licenses, and fees**: are all taxes and miscellaneous fees paid by the insurer excluding federal income taxes. Premium taxes and licensing fees are examples of items included in this category.

### Underwriting Profit (UW Profit)
The two primary profit sources for insurance companies are underwriting profit and investment income. 
- **Underwriting profit**, also known as operating income, is the profit from individual policies calculated as income minus expenses, similar to profit definitions in other industries.
- **Investment income**  is the profit from investing the funds that the insurance company holds.

### Basic Insurance Ratios
A set of basic ratios to monitor and evaluate the appropriateness of an insurance companyâ€™s rates. 

- **Frequency**: is a measure of the rate at which claims occur and is normally calculated as $$ Frequency = \frac{Number of Claims}{Number of Exposures} $$. For example, if the number of claims is 100,000 and the number of earned exposures is 2,000,000, then the frequency is 5% (= 100,000 / 2,000,000).
- **Severity**: is a measure of the average cost of claims and is calculated as $$ Severity = \frac{Losses}{Number of Claims} $$. For example, if the total loss dollars are $300,000,000 and the number of claims is 100,000, then the severity is
$3,000 (= $300,000,000 / 100,000). 
  - paid severity is calculated using paid losses on closed claims divided by closed claims.
  - Reported severity is calculated using reported losses and reported claims.
  - Additionally, ALAE may be included or excluded from the numerator. Consequently, it is important to clearly document the types of losses and claims used in calculating the ratio.
- **Pure Premium (or Loss Cost)**: is a measure of the average loss per exposure and is calculated as $$ Pure Premium = \frac{Losses}{Number of Exposures} = Frequency X Severity $$ For example, if total loss dollars are $300,000,000 and the number of exposures is
2,000,000, then the pure premium is $150 (= $300,000,000 / 2,000,000 = 5.0% x $3,000).
  - Typically, pure premium is calculated using reported losses (or ultimate losses) and earned exposures.
  - The reported losses may or may not include ALAE and/or ULAE. As companies may choose to use other inputs depending on the specific needs, it is important to document the inputs chosen.

- **Average Premium**: A typical ratio is average premium, which is calculated as $$ Average Premium = \frac{Premuim}{Number Of Expesures} $$ For example, if the total premium is $400,000,000 and the total exposures are 2,000,000, then the average
premium is $200 (=$400,000,000 / 2,000,000).
   - It is important that the premium and the exposures be on the same basis (e.g., written, earned, or in-force).
   - Changes in average premium, if adjusted for rate change activity, highlight changes in the mix of business written (e.g., shifts toward higher or lower risk characteristics reflected in rates). 

- **Loss Ratio**: is a measure of the portion of each premium dollar used to pay losses and is calculated as $$ Loss Ratio = \frac{Losses}{Premium} = \frac{Pure premium}{Average Premium}. For example, if the total loss dollars are $300,000,000 and the total premium is $400,000,000, then the
loss ratio is 75% (= $300,000,000 / $400,000,000).
   - Typically, the ratio uses total reported losses and total earned premium; however, other variations are common
   - For example, companies may include LAE in the calculation of loss ratios (commonly referred to as loss and LAE ratios). Once again, it is important to
clarify the inputs being used. 
   - Historically, most companies monitor and analyze the loss and LAE ratio as a primary measure of the adequacy of the rates overall and for various key segments of the portfolio.

- **Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio (LAE Ratio)**: compares the amount of claim-related expense to total losses and is calculated as $$ \frac{LAERatio} = {Loss Adjustment Expenses}{Losses}$$
    - The loss adjustment expenses include both allocated and unallocated loss adjustment expenses. Companies may differ as to whether paid or reported (incurred) figures are used.
    - Companies monitor this ratio over time to determine if costs associated with claim settlement procedures are stable or not. A company may compare its ratio to those of other companies as a benchmark for its claims settlement procedures. 

- **Underwriting Expense Ratio**: is a measure of the portion of each premium dollar used to pay for underwriting expenses, and it is calculated as $$ UW Expense Ratio = \frac {UW Expense}{Premium} $$

- **Operating Expense Ratio**: is a measure of the portion of each premium dollar used to pay for loss adjustment and underwriting expenses and is calculated as  $$ OER = UW Expense Ratio + \frac {LAE}{Earned Premium} $$
   - The OER is used to monitor operational expenditures and is key to determining overall profitability. 
- **Combined Ratio**: is the combination of the loss and expense ratios, and historically has been calculated as $$ Combined Ratio = Loss ratio + \frac{LAE}{Earned Premium} + \frac{Underwriting Expenses}{Written Premium} $$
   - In calculating the combined ratio, the loss ratio should not include LAE or it will be double counted. 
   - some companies may compare underwriting expenses incurred throughout the policy to earned premium rather than to written premium. In this case,
the companies may choose to define combined ratio as $$ Combined Ratio = Loss Ratio + OER $$ 
as

- **Retention Ratio**: is a measure of the rate at which existing insureds renew their policies upon expiration. The retention ratio is defined as $$ Retention Ratio = \frac{Number of Policies Renewed}{Number of potential Renewal Policies} If 100,000 policies are invited to renew in a particular month and 85,000 of the insureds choose to renew,
then the retention ratio is 85% (= 85,000 / 100,000).
   - Retention ratios and changes in the retention ratios are monitored closely by product management and
marketing departments
   - Retention ratios are used to gauge the competitiveness of rates and are very closely examined following rate changes or major changes in service
- **Close Ratio**: is a measure of the rate at which prospective insureds accept a new business quote. The close ratio is defined as $$ Closs ratio = \frac{Number of Accepted Quotes}{Number of Quotes} $$ For example, if the company provides 300,000 quotes in a particular month and generates 60,000 new
policies from those quotes, then the close ratio is 20% (= 60,000 / 300,000).
   - a prospective insured may receive multiple quotes and companies may count that as one quote or may consider each quote
separately.
   - Close ratios and changes in the close ratios are monitored closely by product management and marketing
departments.
   - Closed ratios are used to determine the competitiveness of rates for new business
