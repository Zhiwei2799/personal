This note is designed for my personal use; it's not a comprehensive SQL cheat sheet, as I only record the functions/codes that I think are worthy

## Date
### Current Date and Time
To get the current date and time, most SQL databases provide functions like `NOW()`, `CURRENT_DATE`, and `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.

- SELECT `CURRENT_DATE`
  - Returns the current date
- SELECT `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
  - Returns the current date and time


### Extracting Date Parts
You can extract specific parts of a date (like year, month, day, hour, etc.) using the `EXTRACT()` function or specific functions like `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, and `DAY()`.

- SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) AS Year
- SELECT `MONTH(CURRENT_DATE)` AS Month
- SELECT `DAY(CURRENT_DATE)` AS Day


###  Date Arithmetic/DATEDIFF
You can add or subtract days, weeks, months, or years to a date using functions like `DATE_ADD` or `DATE_SUB`, or by using interval arithmetic.


- SELECT CURRENT_DATE + `INTERVAL 1 DAY`
  - Adds 1 day to the current date
- SELECT CURRENT_DATE - `INTERVAL 7 DAY`
  - Subtracts 7 days from the current date

- MySQL
   - SELECT `DATEDIFF('2023-04-01', '2023-01-01')` AS DaysBetween
     - Calculate the number of days between two dates
- PostgreSQL
   - SELECT '2023-04-01'::date - '2023-01-01'::date AS DaysBetween
     - Calculate the number of days between two dates
   - SELECT AGE('2023-04-01'::date, '2023-01-01'::date) AS DateDifference
     - Calculate the precise age between two dates

- SQL Server
   - SELECT DATEDIFF(day, '2023-01-01', '2023-04-01') AS DaysBetween
     - Calculate the number of days between two dates
   - SELECT DATEDIFF(month, '2023-01-01', '2023-04-01') AS MonthsBetween
     - Calculate the number of months between two dates

- Oracle
   - SELECT (TO_DATE('2023-04-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') - TO_DATE('2023-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD')) AS DaysBetween
     - Calculate the number of days between two dates


### Formatting Dates
To format dates into a specific string format, you might use the `DATE_FORMAT()` function in MySQL or `TO_CHAR()` in PostgreSQL and Oracle.

- MySQL
   - SELECT `DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE, '%Y-%m-%d')`

- PostgreSQL or Oracle
   - SELECT `TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'YYYY-MM-DD')`


### Comparing Dates
You can compare dates to filter records in a `WHERE` clause.

- SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2023-01-01'
  
- SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date `BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31'`

### Date Conversion
Sometimes you might need to convert strings to dates or vice versa. Functions like `STR_TO_DATE()` in MySQL or `TO_DATE()` in PostgreSQL and Oracle can be used.

- MySQL
  - SELECT `STR_TO_DATE('2023-01-01', '%Y-%m-%d')`

- PostgreSQL or Oracle
  - SELECT `TO_DATE('2023-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD')`

### Time Zone Conversions
Handling time zones can be crucial for applications spanning multiple regions.

- PostgreSQL 
  - SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'
  - SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York'
