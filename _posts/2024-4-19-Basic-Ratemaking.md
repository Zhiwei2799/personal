## Chapter 1 Introduction
**FUNDAMENTAL INSURANCE EQUATION**
- **Price = Cost + Profit**
- **Premium= Losses + LAE + UW Expenses + UW Profit**
### Exposure 
The basic unit of risk underlying the insurance premium includes written, earned, unearned, and in-force exposures
- **Written exposures** are the total exposures arising from policies issued (i.e., underwritten or
written) during a specified period of time, such as a calendar year or quarter.
- **Earned exposures** represent the portion of the written exposures for which coverage has already
been provided as of a certain point in time.
- **Unearned exposures** represent the portion of the written exposures for which coverage has not
yet been provided as of that point in time.
- **In-force exposures** are the number of insured units that are exposed to loss at a given point in
time. 

### Premium
 The amount the insured pays for insurance coverage includes written, earned, unearned, and in-force premium
- **Written premium** is the total premium associated with policies that were issued during a
specified period.
- **Earned premium** represents the portion of the written premium for which coverage has already
been provided as of a certain point in time.
- **Unearned premium** is the portion of the written premium for which coverage has yet to be
provided as of a certain point in time.
- **In-force premium** is the full-term premium for policies that are in effect at a given point in time.

### Claim
- An **insurance policy** entails the insured paying a premium to the insurer for coverage against specific events. 
- When such an event occurs, the insured (now the **claimant**) files a claim. The event's date is known as the **date of loss** or **accident date**.
- Claims unknown to the insurer at a given time are termed **unreported claims** or **incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims**
- After the report date, a claim becomes known to the company and is classified as a **reported claim**. It remains an **open claim** until settled, after which it is considered closed. However, claims can be reopened if further activity occurs post-closure.

### Losses	
Loss under an insurance policy is the compensation amount payable to the claimant. Loss terminology includes paid loss, case reserve, reported or case incurred loss, IBNR/IBNER reserves, and ultimate loss. 
- **Paid loss** is amounts already disbursed to the claimant.
- **Case reserve** is an estimate of the amount of money required to ultimately settle the claim, it excludes any payments already made. 
- **Reported loss** is equal to Paid loss + Case reserve
- **Ultimate loss** is the total required to settle the claim. Estimated Ultimate Loss equal to Reported Loss + IBNR Reserve + IBNER Reserve. 

### Loss Adjustment Expense (LAE)
In addition to the money paid to the claimant for compensation, **loss adjustment expenses (LAE)** are costs insurers incur while settling claims, divided into **allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE)** and **unallocated
loss adjustment expenses (ULAE)**:

LAE =  ALAE + ULAE.

- ALAE are claim-related expenses that are directly attributable to a specific claim; for example, fees
associated with outside legal counsel hired to defend a claim can be directly assigned to a specific claim.
- ULAE are claim-related expenses that cannot be directly assigned to a specific claim. For example,
salaries of claims department personnel are not readily assignable to a specific claim and are categorized
as ULAE.

### Underwriting Expenses (UW Expenses)
In addition to loss adjustment expenses, underwriting expenses are costs insurers incur for various expenses in acquiring and servicing policies. 
- **Commissions and brokerage**: are payments made to insurance agents or brokers for generating business.
- **Other acquisition costs**: are expenses beyond commissions and brokerage, such as those for media advertising and mailings to potential customers.
- **General expenses**: are the operational and any other miscellaneous costs. For example, upkeep for the home office.
- **Taxes, licenses, and fees**: are all taxes and miscellaneous fees paid by the insurer excluding federal income taxes. Premium taxes and licensing fees are examples of items included in this category.

### Underwriting Profit (UW Profit)
The two primary profit sources for insurance companies are underwriting profit and investment income. 
- **Underwriting profit**, also known as operating income, is the profit from individual policies calculated as income minus expenses, similar to profit definitions in other industries.
- **Investment income**  is the profit from investing the funds that the insurance company holds.

### Basic Insurance Ratios
A set of basic ratios to monitor and evaluate the appropriateness of an insurance companyâ€™s rates. 


- **Frequency**: is a measure of the rate at which claims occur and is normally calculated as $$ \text{Frequency} = \frac{ \text{# of Claims}}{\text{# of Exposures}} $$.
  - Help measure the effectiveness of specific underwriting actions. 
  - For example, if the number of claims is 100,000 and the number of earned exposures is 2,000,000, then the frequency is 5% (= 100,000 / 2,000,000).


- **Severity**: is a measure of the average cost of claims and is calculated as $$ \text{Severity} = \frac{\text{Losses}}{\text{# of Claims}} $$.
  - $$ \text{Paid Severity} = \frac{\text{Paid Losses}}{\text{# of Claims Closed}} $$
  - $$ \text{Reported Severity} = \frac{\text{Reported Losses}}{\text{# of Claims Reported}} $$
  - Additionally, ALAE may be included or excluded from the numerator.
  - Help measure the loss trends. 
  - For example, if the total loss dollars are $300,000,000 and the number of claims is 100,000, then the severity is
$3,000 (= $300,000,000 / 100,000). 


- **Pure Premium (or Loss Cost)**: is a measure of the average loss per exposure and is calculated as $$ \text{Pure Premium} = \frac{\text{Losses}}{\text{# of Exposures}} = Frequency \times Severity $$
  - Typically, reported losses (or ultimate losses) and earned exposures are used.
  - The reported losses may or may not include ALAE and/or ULAE.
  - Help measure the overall loss cost trends.
  - For example, if total loss dollars are $300,000,000 and the number of exposures is 2,000,000, then the pure premium is $150 (= $300,000,000 / 2,000,000 = 5.0% x $3,000).


- **Average Premium**: A typical ratio is average premium, which is calculated as $$ \text{Average Premium} = \frac{\text{Premuim}}{\text{# Of Expesures}} $$
premium is $200 (=$400,000,000 / 2,000,000).
   - It is important that the premium and the exposures be on the same basis (e.g., written, earned, or in-force).
   - Changes in average premium may indicate
      - Rate change
      - Change in the mix of business, e.g. deductible shift, insured limit shift, risk shifts, and etc. 
    - For example, if the total premium is $400,000,000 and the total exposures are 2,000,000, then the average


- **Loss Ratio**: is a measure of the portion of each premium dollar used to pay losses and is calculated as $$ \text{Loss Ratio} = \frac{\text{Losses}}{\text{Premium}} = \frac{\text{Pure premium}}{\text{Average Premium}}$$.
   - Typically, the ratio uses total reported losses and total earned premiums; however, other variations are common. Companies may include LAE in the calculation of loss ratios (commonly referred to as loss and LAE ratios).
   - Help measure the adequacy of the rates
   - For example, if the total loss dollars are $300,000,000 and the total premium is $400,000,000, then the loss ratio is 75% (= $300,000,000 / $400,000,000).


- **Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio (LAE Ratio)**: compares the amount of claim-related expense to total losses and is calculated as $$ {\text{LAERatio}} = \frac{\text{Loss Adjustment Expenses}}{\text{Losses}}$$
    - The loss adjustment expenses include both allocated and unallocated loss adjustment expenses. Companies may differ as to whether paid or reported (incurred) figures are used.
    - Companies monitor this ratio over time to determine if costs associated with claim settlement procedures are stable or not. A company may compare its ratio to those of other companies as a benchmark for its claims settlement procedures.

     

- **Underwriting Expense Ratio**: is a measure of the portion of each premium dollar used to pay for underwriting expenses, and it is calculated as $$ \text{UW Expense Ratio} = \frac {\text{UW Expense}}{\text{Premium}} $$


- **Operating Expense Ratio**: is a measure of the portion of each premium dollar used to pay for loss adjustment and underwriting expenses and is calculated as  $$ \text{OER} = \text{UW Expense Ratio} + \frac {\text{LAE}} {\text{Earned Premium}} $$
   - The OER is used to monitor operational expenditures and is key to determining overall profitability.

 
- **Combined Ratio**: is the combination of the loss and expense ratios, and historically has been calculated as $$ \text{Combined Ratio} = \text{Loss ratio} + \frac{\text{LAE}}{\text{Earned Premium}} + \frac{\text{Underwriting Expenses}}{\text{Written Premium}} $$
   - In calculating the combined ratio, the loss ratio should not include LAE or it will be double counted. 
   - some companies may compare underwriting expenses incurred throughout the policy to earned premiums rather than to written premiums. In this case,
the companies may choose to define combined ratio as $$ \text{Combined Ratio} = \text{Loss Ratio} + \text{OER} $$ 
as


- **Retention Ratio**: is a measure of the rate at which existing insureds renew their policies upon expiration. The retention ratio is defined as $$ \text{Retention Ratio} = \frac{\text{# of Policies Renewed}}{\text{# of potential Renewal Policies}}.
   - Retention ratios and changes in the retention ratios are monitored closely by product management and
marketing departments
   - Retention ratios are used to gauge the competitiveness of rates and are very closely examined following rate changes or major changes in service
   - If 100,000 policies are invited to renew in a particular month and 85,000 of the insureds choose to renew,
then the retention ratio is 85% (= 85,000 / 100,000).

- **Close Ratio**: is a measure of the rate at which prospective insureds accept a new business quote. The close ratio is defined as $$ \text{Closs ratio} = \frac{\text{# of Accepted Quotes}}{\text{# of Quotes}} $$. 
   - a prospective insured may receive multiple quotes and companies may count that as one quote or may consider each quote
separately.
   - Close ratios and changes in the close ratios are monitored closely by product management and marketing
departments.
   - Closed ratios are used to determine the competitiveness of rates for new business.
   - If the company provides 300,000 quotes in a particular month and generates 60,000 new
policies from those quotes, then the close ratio is 20% (= 60,000 / 300,000).
